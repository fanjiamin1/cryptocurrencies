use hash of public key as ID for clients, 
	still need a central authority with public keys

functionality extension: multiple in-multiple out transfers
verify needs to only check whether or not transaction ID gave them that
amount of money, no need for payers id to be involved


refactoring request: Maintain list of valid accounts, be ready to
backtrack. Use blockchaining, add identity of last chain and hash of last chain
